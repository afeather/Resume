Work Experience
2019 - Present

Principal Software Engineer for Northrop Grumman, Melbourne FL
Developed Python scripts to verify the Stores Management System behaves as described
in the requirements and helping to debug issues as they were discovered.
Created Python and Bash utilities to configure the system in order to make testing more
consistent and repeatable, as well as incorporated them into the build process to make
them available to multiple teams.
Created utilities that allow test scripts to communicate with the system through MILSTD-1760 signals in both simulated and physical environments. This required working
closely with electrical engineers to understand the hardware connections as well as using
lower level interfaces to manipulate these signals on hardware from the test scripts.
Responsible for updating and configuring the Subsystem tests to run on hardware, identifying issues and training other team members about the best design patterns for writing
tests that would perform as expected in both simulated and physical environments.
Created Python objects to emulate different aircraft systems in order to test functionality
that relied on these systems.
Designed and implemented a test framework for the Store Emulator in order to verify
the behavior described by the Universal Armament Interface ICD. Also responsible for
developing tests and debugging issues as functionality was implemented as well as setting
up the test suite to run periodically in an automated environment.
Created a MiDEF parser using MIL-STD-3014 in C# in order to both encode and decode
data that was then incorporated into other applications.
Subject Matter Expert for multiple areas as well as being responsible for training new hires
and other developers in order to promote knowledge sharing.

2015 - 2019

Programmer Analyst for DXC Bath Iron Works Account, Bath ME
Technical Lead for the Work Authorization Implementation which used an Oracle SQL
database to query multiple sources for charging information, validate which charges should
be sent to the Time Accounting System and then send updates to the system in almost
real time. This was a major success as the old implementation would process only a couple
hundred thousand records in an overnight batch process whereas the new implementation
was processing almost two million records every fifteen minutes.
Technical Lead for the Tool Management and Learning Management Integration which
required creating a Java Web Service that would query the Learning Management System
to verify the corresponding training had been completed before sending a response back
to the Tool Management System that would allow the user to receive the requested tools.
Technical Lead for the Learning Management Implementation which required vetting products from different vendors based on the functionality required by the shipyard, creating
interfaces to keep the system up to date with active employees, creating logical representations of existing training certifications in the new system and finally transferring current
and historical completed training from the old system to the new system without losing
any information in order to guarantee the accuracy of each employees training.
Technical Lead for the Finance System Database Migration which required updating,
testing and documenting close to fifty legacy applications written in SQL, Visual Basic,
Windows Batch and Java to prove to the customer there would be no interruption to
production during the migration.
Responsible for training an intern about best practices for development as well as how to
properly resolve issues as they were reported by the customer.

2014 - 2015

Application Developer for Fujifilm, Bedford MA
Contract position to create the Dternity Deep Archive Portal which allowed customers to
manage stored physical backups through a web portal.
The web portal was written in ASP.NET and queried a Microsoft SQL database in order
to view files stored in backups as well as create requests to retrieve backed up files.
Python and Bash scripts were used to create customer accounts with their own partitioned
FTP server that was linked to their web portal login as well as update the Miscrosoft SQL
database with the files stored in each physical backup received from the customer.
Created an ASP.NET application that would generate a name tag and automatically send
the image to an external printer using device drivers in order to identify visitors.

2013

Web Developer Intern for BMighty2, Lincoln VT
Created small business websites on the WordPress Content Management System in a team
environment using PHP, CSS, JQuery and MySQL.
Developed WordPress widgets and plugins to allow for functionality to be easily re-used
across multiple websites.

Education
2011 - 2014

BS Computer Science, Loughborough University, England
Final Year Project was titled The Implementation and Optimization of the SHA2 and SHA3
Hashing Algorithms which involved implementing the algorithms in Java.
